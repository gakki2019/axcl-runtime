1. Relevant Commands:
    •./build.sh clean -- Cleans only (removes build artifacts).
    •./build.sh all -- Compiles FFmpeg without cleaning.
    •./build.sh all debug -- Compiles FFmpeg with debugging information included in the binaries and shared objects (.so files).
    •./build.sh install "/home/public/ffmpeg" -- Copies the compiled binaries and related shared objects to the /home/public/ffmpeg directory.

2. The binaries and shared objects generated by the above compilation commands are located in the install directory.

   To compile for the x86 environment, please use build_x86.sh, which uses the same parameters as described above.
